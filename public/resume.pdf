# Placeholder Resume PDF

This file is a placeholder for Christopher Vargas's resume. In a real deployment, this would be replaced with the actual PDF resume file.

To add the real resume:
1. Save the resume as a PDF file
2. Replace this file with the actual resume.pdf
3. Ensure the file name remains "resume.pdf" for the download links to work correctly

The resume download links throughout the site point to "/resume.pdf"
